## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Forest green (#388E3C) to represent sustainability and nature.
- Background color: Light beige (#F5F5DC), a desaturated color visually related to forest green. To enhance the user's feeling of environmental awareness, let this background show through most of the design wherever possible.
- Accent color: Earthy brown (#A1887F) to provide contrast and highlight key elements. Use this to create areas with darker emphasis against the beige background, providing contrast, yet harmonious.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif font that gives an elegant and contemporary feel
- Use of environmental and travel-related icons throughout the site. A minimalist vector style would suit the aesthetic and convey a clean and simple message. Use an open source icon set.
- Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a user-friendly experience on all devices. Cards should contain all the core destination data.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user engagement and provide visual feedback on interactions.
